## Getting Started

### Install the Dependencies

This project uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). First of all, make sure you have it globally installed by following the instructions [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

Then, go to the project's root and install its dependencies:

```{bash}
mvn clean install
```

To start the app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), run the following command:

```{bash}
mvn exec:java -pl app
```

### Run the Tests

We use [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) as our testing framework. To run the `unit tests`, execute the following command:

```{bash}
mvn test
```

We use [Jacoco](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/) to build the test coverage reports. You can view those reports at [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/JulieTetrault/property-rental-api).

### Run the Linter

We use the [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org/) plugin to check the validity of the `Java` files. You can run the linter with the following command:

```{bash}
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```
